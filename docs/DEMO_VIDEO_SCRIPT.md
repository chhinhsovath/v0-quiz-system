## 📝 Script

### SCENE 1: Introduction (30 seconds)

**[SCREEN: OpenPLP homepage or login screen]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Hello teachers! In this quick tutorial, I'll show you how to use the Answer Randomization feature to prevent cheating on your quizzes. This feature shuffles the order of answer options for each student, making it much harder for them to share answers. Let's get started!"

**[ACTION: Gentle fade to next scene]**

---

### SCENE 2: The Problem (30 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Split screen showing two student screens with SAME quiz]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Here's the problem we're solving. Without randomization, all students see the exact same quiz with answers in the same position. A student can simply text 'The answer is B' to a friend, and that's all they need. Screen peeking also becomes very effective."

**[SCREEN: Show mock chat message: "Q1 = B, Q2 = A, Q3 = D"]**

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "This makes cheating too easy 😟"]**

---

### SCENE 3: The Solution (30 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Split screen showing two student screens with DIFFERENT option orders]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "With Answer Randomization enabled, each student sees the same questions, but the options appear in a different order. Student 1 might see the correct answer in position B, while Student 2 sees it in position D. Now sharing 'The answer is B' is useless!"

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Same content, different order ✅"]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Let me show you how to set this up. It takes less than one minute."

---

### SCENE 4: Login and Navigate (15 seconds)

**VOICEOVER:**

---

### SCENE 6: Add Questions (60 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Question editor]**

**VOICEOVER:**

**[ACTION: Type question and options]**
- Question: "What is the capital of Cambodia?"

- Option D: Vientiane

**[ACTION: Select "Phnom Penh" as correct answer]**

**VOICEOVER:**

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Select by content, not position ✅"]**

**[ACTION: Click "Save Question"]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Let me quickly add two more questions..."

**[SCREEN: Fast-forward animation showing adding 2 more questions]**

**[ACTION: Highlight or circle the toggle with cursor]**

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "← This is what you're looking for!"]**

**VOICEOVER:**

**[SCREEN: Toggle turns blue/active with animation]**

**VOICEOVER:**

---

### SCENE 8: Optional Settings (30 seconds)

D. Vientiane

**[ACTION: Login as different student, start same quiz]**

**[SCREEN: Quiz starts, showing Question 1]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Same question, but look at the options now:"

**[TEXT OVERLAY: Display option order with arrows]**
```
A. Vientiane
B. Bangkok
C. Hanoi
D. Phnom Penh  ← Correct answer in position D
```

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Completely different order! The correct answer is now in position D instead of B. This is the randomization in action."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Different order = Sharing answers won't help ✅"]**

---

### SCENE 12: Side-by-Side Comparison (30 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Split screen showing both student views]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Let's compare them side by side. Same question, same four options, but in different order for each student."

Student 1:          Student 2:
A. Hanoi       →    C. Hanoi
B. Phnom Penh  →    D. Phnom Penh
C. Bangkok     →    B. Bangkok
D. Vientiane   →    A. Vientiane
```

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "✅ Same content | ✅ Different order | ✅ Harder to cheat"]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "If Student 1 tries to share 'The answer is B', it won't help Student 2, because B is Bangkok for them, not Phnom Penh."

---

### SCENE 13: Grading Still Works (30 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Back to Student 1 view]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "You might wonder: does this affect grading? Let me show you it doesn't."

**[ACTION: Select correct answer "Phnom Penh" which is in position B]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Student 1 selects B, which is Phnom Penh for them."

**[ACTION: Submit quiz]**

**[SCREEN: Back to Student 2 view]**

**[ACTION: Select correct answer "Phnom Penh" which is in position D]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Student 2 selects D, which is Phnom Penh for them."

**[ACTION: Submit quiz]**

**VOICEOVER:**

### SCENE 15: Best Practices (45 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Text slide or presenter talking head (optional)]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Before we wrap up, here are three quick best practices:"

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Best Practice #1"]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "First, avoid using position references in your questions or options. Don't say 'Choose option A' or 'Both A and B above'. Instead, use the actual content like 'Choose Bangkok' or 'Both Bangkok and Hanoi'."

**[SCREEN: Show example of wrong vs right]**
```
❌ Wrong: "Both A and B above"
✅ Right: "Both Bangkok and Hanoi"
```

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Best Practice #2"]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Second, always test your quiz with a test account before publishing. Make sure the randomization works and grading is accurate."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Best Practice #3"]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Third, inform your students that options will appear in different order. This reduces confusion and encourages them to read all options carefully instead of memorizing positions."

**[SCREEN: Example announcement]**
```
"Note: Answer options will appear in different
order for each student. Read carefully!"
```
